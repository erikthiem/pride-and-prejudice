Download Pride and Prejudice text from Project Gutenberg. It's the most popular ebook on their site (as of 11/28/2017). https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top
so it seems like a good place to start. Download this in plaintext format so that it's easiest to work with. https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt

Edit this text to remove the start and ending Project Gutenberg-added information. This is a bit of copyright information and just some general description of Pride and Prejudice. While I'm sure this information is important, it is not the text of Pride and Prejudice and keeping it there will just mess up the alogorithms. Then, go through and remove all "Chapter X" headers since they are also extraneous.
